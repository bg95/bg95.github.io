            <p>
                Ge Bai joins AI Thrust, Information Hub, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) in March 2025 as an assistant professor. His research focuses on quantum information, including quantum causal inference, quantum machine learning, quantum communication network theory, quantum benchmarking, quantum error correction, quantum information theory, etc. Before joining HKUST(GZ), he worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Centre for Quantum Technologies in the National University of Singapore. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Hong Kong in 2021 and was awarded the Hong Kong Institution of Science Young Scientist Award. He has published nearly 20 papers in top journals in the field of quantum information such as Physical Review Letters, Nature Communications, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, npj Quantum Information, Quantum, and has made many oral reports at conferences such as AQIS and Quantum Resources. He is a reviewer for many top journals and conferences such as Physical Review Letters, QIP, and AQIS.
